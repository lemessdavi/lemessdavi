🎓 Background:
I have been coding since 2017 and started my journey in High School with a Certificate in Systems Development at SENAI-SJ in 2018. I successfully graduated from both programs in 2020. During my studies, I dedicated time to expand my knowledge through online courses at Alura.com, which are all listed on my LinkedIn profile.

I have an extended knowledge of software design patterns, including MVC, Builder, and Method Factory, among others. Understanding these patterns has been instrumental in developing efficient and maintainable software solutions.

🚀 Latest Projects:
I'm proud to showcase my latest projects, Teachfy and TicketPortal, both of which are public on my GitHub. Teachfy, built in Laravel, demonstrates my skills in web development, while TicketPortal, developed using Java, Spring Boot, and PostgreSQL, highlights my expertise in back-end development.
